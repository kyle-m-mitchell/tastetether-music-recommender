# TasteTether Model Card

## 1. Model Name  

**TasteTether 1.0** — a deterministic content-based music recommender simulation built for CodePath AI110. It uses hand-set scoring rules rather than a trained model or a runtime AI service. [Cadence](https://github.com/kyle-m-mitchell/cadence-ai-music-companion) is the later, broader application.

---

## 2. Intended Use  

My recommender is designed to gather the music "taste" of a user and suggest songs based off of their preferences. The system assumes the user would prefer listening to their favorite genre, at that moment, by default and returns a list of songs, fine-tuned to their preferences. This is purely for classroom exploration.

---

## 3. How the Model Works  

Real world recommenders tend to be hybrids of content-based filtering and
collaborative filtering. Content based filtering compares a single user's
preference with the attributes of an item to suggest content to the user. My
simulation is content based. It scores each song by how closely its attributes
match a user's taste profile, using no data about other users. It prioritizes
genre most heavily, then mood, then how close a song's numeric qualities are to
what the user wants. Genre is *provably* the decisive signal: its weight (4.0)
is set to exceed everything else combined (mood 1.5 + numeric budget 2.0 = 3.5),
so an exact-genre song always outranks any unrelated-genre song while the mood
and numeric features fine-tune the ranking within a genre.

In plain terms, each song earns points for what it gets right: a matching genre
or mood adds a fixed number of points, and each numeric quality (energy,
valence, danceability, acousticness) adds more points the closer it is to the
user's target. Genre is worth the most points, mood a little less, and the
numeric qualities the least. Every song's points are added into one total score,
and the songs are then ranked from highest to lowest so the best matches appear
first.

**Song features used:** genre, mood, energy, acousticness, valence,
danceability, tempo.

**UserProfile preferences considered:** favorite_genre, favorite_mood,
target_energy, target_acousticness, target_valence, target_danceability,
target_tempo (in BPM). Genre and mood are matched case-insensitively.

Every preference has exactly one song attribute it's compared against.

---

## 4. Data  

The catalog contains **20 songs**. Each song has a title, artist, genre, mood,
and five numeric audio features (energy, tempo, valence, danceability,
acousticness).

The starter file included 10 songs across 7 genres (pop, lofi, rock, ambient,
jazz, synthwave, indie pop) and 6 moods (happy, chill, intense, relaxed, moody,
focused). I added 10 more songs to widen the range, introducing 10 new genres
(hip hop, classical, reggae, metal, country, edm, blues, folk, r&b, funk) and 10
new moods (energetic, melancholy, uplifting, aggressive, nostalgic, euphoric,
somber, hopeful, romantic, playful). The catalog now spans 17 genres and 16
moods.

What's still missing: most genres are represented by only one or two songs, so
the data can't show how varied a single genre really is. There are also no
lyrics, language, release year, or artist popularity, and no information about
listeners at all — which is exactly why a collaborative (people-like-you)
approach isn't possible with this dataset.

---

## 5. Strengths  

TasteTether does three things well:

**Coherent picks when a taste is clear.** When a profile's dials agree — a genre,
a mood, and sound targets that all point the same way — the results form a tight,
sensible cluster. The *Workout* profile (edm + energetic + loud/fast) returns edm
on top followed by its closest pop and synthwave cousins in energy order, and the
*Study* profile (lofi + chill + calm/quiet) returns a clean run of lofi and
mellow tracks. In these everyday cases the recommendations match intuition
(see Section 7).

**Graceful fallback to "cousin" genres and moods.** Instead of collapsing to
nothing when exact matches run out, the similarity families award partial credit
to related genres and moods, so a lofi listener sees ambient and jazz before
anything jarring. The list degrades smoothly from exact matches, to close
cousins, to everything else.

**Simple, fast, and needs no training data.** The whole model is a weighted sum a
person can read top to bottom and adjust by hand. It runs instantly on the
catalog with no user history, no training step, and no outside services, which
makes it easy to reason about and easy to test.

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias

**Discovered weakness — the family-size lottery.** The most serious bias is a
filter bubble whose severity depends on *which* family a listener happens to fall
into. Genre is weighted 4.0 specifically so an exact-genre match always outranks
any unrelated genre, which locks the top of every list to the user's genre and
its hand-drawn family and makes cross-genre discovery effectively impossible.
That would be fair if every family were equally deep, but they are not: the
20-song catalog gives *mellow* six songs and *pop_elec* five, while *rock_heavy*
has only two (rock, metal) and 15 of the 17 genres appear exactly once. The
result is unequal recommendation quality. A lofi (mellow) fan receives five
coherent, high-confidence picks entirely inside their comfort zone (scores
4.4–7.3), whereas a metal (rock_heavy) fan gets metal, then rock, and then falls
off a cliff into unrelated genres — hip hop, pop, country — surfaced purely on
numeric noise at scores near 2, barely a third of the exact match. Because the
score carries no confidence signal, this filler is presented with exactly the
same authority as a real match, so users with narrow or underrepresented tastes
are quietly served near-random recommendations dressed up as personalized ones.

---

## 7. Evaluation  

### Everyday profiles I tested

Think of a taste profile as a set of dials: one for **genre**, one for **mood**,
and five sliders for the sound itself (energy, acousticness, valence,
danceability, and tempo). To see what each dial actually *does*, I tested the
profiles in **pairs**, changing only one dial at a time and leaving everything
else identical. That way, any change in the recommendations can only be caused
by the one dial I moved.

| Nickname | Genre | Mood | Sliders | #1 recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Study** | lofi | chill | calm & quiet (low energy, 75 bpm, acoustic) | Library Rain *(lofi)* |
| **Study→Metal** | metal | chill | calm & quiet *(same as Study)* | Iron Verdict *(metal)* |
| **Study→Energetic** | lofi | energetic | calm & quiet *(same as Study)* | Library Rain *(lofi)* |
| **Study→Hype** | lofi | chill | loud & fast (high energy, 135 bpm, danceable) | Midnight Coding *(lofi)* |
| **Workout** | edm | energetic | loud & fast | Neon Cathedral *(edm)* |

**Pair 1 — change only the genre (Study vs Study→Metal): what does the "genre"
dial control?** I kept the mood (chill) and every slider (quiet, slow, acoustic)
exactly the same and changed a single word, lofi → metal. The whole list flipped:
a calm lofi track on top became a loud metal track on top. The surprising part is
that the metal song that comes back, *Iron Verdict*, is loud, fast, and
"aggressive" — the exact opposite of the quiet, chill settings I asked for, yet
it still wins.
That makes sense: the genre dial outranks everything else combined, so it decides
the *neighborhood* you get recommended from even when your other dials disagree
with it. This is valid behavior (genre is meant to be decisive), but it also
shows the profile was asking for two contradictory things and genre quietly won.
Notice too that the metal list is much less confident (top score 5.11 vs 7.40 for
the lofi list) and its runners-up are actually the same quiet lofi songs — because
metal has only one song and one close cousin (rock), the list runs out of real
matches almost immediately.

**Pair 2 — change only the mood (Study vs Study→Energetic): what does the "mood"
dial control?** I kept the genre (lofi) and the sliders the same and switched the
mood from chill to energetic. Surprisingly, I got back the *exact same three lofi
songs*, just with lower scores and a slightly shuffled order. The reason is that
none of the lofi songs are "energetic" (they are chill or focused), so asking for
an energetic mood simply removed the mood bonus from all of them — and nobody new
could take their place because genre still dominates. One telling detail: in the
chill version *Midnight Coding* was #2, but in the energetic version it slipped to
#3 while *Focus Flow* rose to #2. That happened because Midnight Coding lost a full
chill-match bonus (1.50 points) while Focus Flow only lost a smaller cousin bonus
(0.75), so the near-ties reshuffled. Takeaway: the mood dial fine-tunes the
emotional flavor *within* your genre and breaks ties — but if your genre has no
songs in that mood, asking for it barely changes *who* you get. It is valid, but
it degrades quietly: it never tells you "there are no energetic lofi songs," it
just hands back the chill ones with a smaller number.

**Pair 3 — change only the sliders (Study vs Study→Hype): what do the sound
sliders control?** I kept the genre (lofi) and mood (chill) and flipped every
slider from calm/quiet/slow to loud/fast/danceable, a workout setting. I *still*
got quiet lofi study music. The only thing that changed was that #1 and #2 traded
places: *Midnight Coding* (a hair louder at energy 0.42 and 78 bpm) edged ahead of
the very quiet *Library Rain* (0.35, 72 bpm), because when you ask for a loud song
the slightly-louder track is the closer match. This makes sense: the sliders are
*fine-tuning knobs, not a steering wheel*. They decide which lofi song rises to the
top; they cannot get you out of lofi. It is valid by design, but a listener who
cranks energy to the maximum expecting gym music — while leaving the genre on
lofi — will be surprised to still receive study beats.

**Pair 4 — change everything (Study vs Workout): does it hold together for a
consistent persona?** Here all three dials agree: a loud electronic genre (edm),
an energetic mood, and loud/fast sliders. The result is a tidy, sensible cluster,
edm on top, then its close pop and synthwave cousins, ordered from most to least
energetic. Compared with the quiet, coherent lofi cluster from Study, this shows
the recommender works cleanly when your preferences all point the same direction.
It is the mirror image of Pair 1's metal profile, where the dials fought each
other and produced a jumbled, low-confidence list. So the system is most
trustworthy when genre, mood, and sliders agree, and least trustworthy when they
contradict — in which case it silently sides with genre.

**What was surprising, in one line.** Two of the three preference types, mood and
the sound sliders, mostly *cannot change who you get recommended*; only the genre
dial can. Moving them just changes the scores and the fine ordering. In plain
terms, a profile really means "pick a genre, then gently sort the songs inside
it," which is worth knowing before trusting the mood and slider settings to steer
the results.

### Adversarial edge-case profiles

I also ran a set of **adversarial edge-case profiles** against the full 20-song
catalog to find where the scoring logic breaks. Each block below is real output
from `recommend_songs`.

**Finding 1 — "genre is decisive" holds only conditionally.** Genre is weighted
3.0, but every other signal combined sums to 5.0 (mood 1.5 + numeric 3.5). A
coherent-looking user ("lofi genre, aggressive mood") gets a **metal** track as
their #1 pick, ahead of every lofi song, because the intruder collects mood +
numeric points that exceed the exact-genre song's total. Genre only "wins" when
no off-genre song can rescue itself that way (profile A).

```
A) genre=lofi, mood=romantic, energy=0.97, acousticness=0.03, valence=0.30, danceability=0.42
  1. Midnight Coding      [lofi/chill]        score=4.91
  2. Focus Flow           [lofi/focused]      score=4.80
  3. Library Rain         [lofi/chill]        score=4.67

B) genre=lofi, mood=aggressive, energy=0.97, acousticness=0.03, valence=0.30, danceability=0.42
  1. Iron Verdict         [metal/aggressive]  score=5.00   <-- wrong genre wins
  2. Midnight Coding      [lofi/chill]        score=4.91
  3. Focus Flow           [lofi/focused]      score=4.80
```

**Finding 2 — no input validation.** Out-of-range numeric targets (typos) clamp
to 0 silently; the model drops all numeric signal and falls back to
categorical-only with no error or warning.

```
C) genre=lofi, mood=chill, energy=9000, acousticness=-5, valence=50, danceability=1e9
  1. Midnight Coding      [lofi/chill]     score=4.50   (numeric contribution: 0)
  2. Library Rain         [lofi/chill]     score=4.50
  3. Focus Flow           [lofi/focused]   score=3.75
```

**Finding 3 — categorical matching is case-sensitive.** `"Lofi"` != `"lofi"`, so
capitalizing the favorite silently discards genre and mood; ranking collapses to
numerics and a **folk** song ties the top lofi track.

```
D) genre=Lofi, mood=Chill, energy=0.40, acousticness=0.80, valence=0.55, danceability=0.40
  1. Focus Flow           [lofi/focused]   score=3.34
  2. Midnight Coding      [lofi/chill]     score=3.27
  3. Paper Compass        [folk/hopeful]   score=3.27   <-- folk ties lofi
```

**Finding 4 — no "nothing matches" signal.** When nothing matches, every song
scores 0.00 and the top picks are just the lowest-`id` songs in catalog order.
An empty profile is indistinguishable from a completely wrong one.

```
E) genre=polka, mood=spicy, energy=500, acousticness=500, valence=500, danceability=500
  1. Sunrise City         [pop/happy]      score=0.00
  2. Midnight Coding      [lofi/chill]     score=0.00
  3. Storm Runner         [rock/intense]   score=0.00

F) {}  (empty profile)  -> identical output to E, i.e. plain id order
```

**What surprised me.** The failure mode is always *silent* — no exception, no
warning, just quietly wrong output. The genre-dominance guarantee I reasoned
about in the README was really a property of this catalog's value ranges, not of
the weights themselves. I also confirmed `tempo_bpm` was loaded but never scored,
so a tempo-driven listener was entirely unserved.

**Changes made in response.** I retuned the weights and re-ran the same
profiles:

- Genre 3.0 → 4.0 and the numeric budget 3.5 → 2.0, enforcing
  `W_genre > W_mood + numerics`. Findings 1 is now closed — profile B returns
  lofi songs on top; a wrong-genre track can no longer win.
- Genre/mood matching is now case-insensitive, closing Finding 3.
- Tempo is now scored (target in BPM, normalized to 0–1), closing the
  never-scored gap.
- Findings E/F (empty / all-miss profile returns catalog order at score 0.00)
  are **still open** — that needs an explicit "no confident matches" signal
  rather than a weight change, and is listed under Future Work.

---

## 8. Future Work  

My testing (Sections 6 and 7) pointed to four concrete next steps:

- **Add a "no confident matches" signal.** Right now an empty or all-miss profile
  still returns five songs at score 0.00 in catalog order (Findings E/F), which
  looks like a real answer. The recommender should notice when nothing clears a
  minimum bar and say so, instead of presenting filler as picks.
- **Inject genre diversity into the top-k.** To soften the filter-bubble /
  family-size lottery from Section 6, the ranker could reserve a slot or two for
  strong matches outside the user's family, trading a little genre purity for
  real discovery.
- **Grow a bigger, deeper catalog.** With 15 of 17 genres represented by a single
  song, results often lean on one track or its cousins. More songs per genre
  would make within-genre ranking meaningful and cut down on the noise-filler
  problem.
- **Support smarter, more expressive preferences.** Allow directional targets
  ("at least this energetic" rather than "near this"), and learn the genre/mood
  families from the data instead of hand-drawing them, so the groupings aren't
  just the designer's judgment calls.

---

## 9. Personal Reflection  

The biggest thing I took away is that bias in a recommender rarely arrives as one
dramatic decision — it hides inside small, reasonable-looking choices. Drawing the
genre "families" by hand felt harmless, and so did working with a small catalog,
but together they quietly produced unfair results: a lofi fan gets a rich,
coherent list while a metal fan falls off a cliff into near-random songs, and
nothing in the output warns anyone that it happened. Watching a single number —
the genre weight — decide who gets a good experience and who doesn't made the
trade-offs feel real in a way I didn't expect going in. It has changed how I look
at the apps I use every day: behind a tidy list of "recommended for you" sit
dozens of quiet judgment calls, and the ones that create bias are usually not the
ones that looked risky up front.
